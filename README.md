# Tableau Airbnb Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This Tableau project provides an interactive analysis of real estate data, focusing on average property prices by bedrooms, prices across different zip codes, and revenue trends over the year. The dashboard aims to give insights into how factors like bedroom count and location affect property prices and the overall revenue generated over time.

The project highlights core data analyst skills, such as data visualization, pattern identification, and interpretation of data trends. The visual dashboard also allows users to easily filter and drill down into the data to extract meaningful insights.

## Key Features
Avg Price by Number of Bedrooms: Displays the average price of listings broken down by the number of bedrooms, providing insight into how property prices change with room count.

Price by Zipcode: Visualizes property prices by zip code using a color-coded map and bar chart, helping users quickly compare average prices across regions.

Revenue for the Year: Tracks revenue across the year, showing trends in real estate income over time. This provides insights into seasonality and fluctuations in revenue.

Listings Count by Bedroom: Displays the count of listings based on the number of bedrooms, helping users understand the distribution of properties available on the market.

## Insights Provided
### Price Trends:

A clear trend is seen between the number of bedrooms and the average price of properties. Properties with more bedrooms have a higher average price, peaking at six-bedroom properties.
### Geographic Price Comparison:

The dashboard highlights price differences across zip codes. Some zip codes have significantly higher average prices, such as 98199, which could indicate more affluent or desirable areas.
### Revenue Tracking:

Revenue is tracked over the course of a year, showcasing patterns in income generation. The data can help identify peak seasons for property sales or rentals.
### Listings Distribution:

There is a clear distribution in the number of listings by bedroom count, with one-bedroom properties being the most common, followed by two-bedroom listings. This gives a sense of the market's supply side.
